# readme-gen

## Description

Tired of creating readme files with the same formatting everytime you are developing a new project? Look no further, this is a README.md generator that automates the process for the user. I built this project because I wanted to solve the tedious process of forming a README.md file that had the same generic sections and with this command line utility. Once the code is running within the terminal the user will be prompted with multiple questions that are about each section of a good README.md file. The answers to the questions will then populate the designated sections and a file will be created with all the information for the user to use. I learned a lot about how to use node packages, create files, and catch errors for the user.

## Table of Contents 

If your README is long, add a table of contents to make it easy for users to find what they need.

## Installation

The steps to take for installing this project are as follows:
1) Clone all the necessary files to project location
2) Open Terminal for project folder
3) Install all dependencies using the command "npm install" in the terminal
4) Enter command "node index.js" in terminal
5) Answer all questions when prompted so that the README.md file begins to fill with content about the project that you are creating

## Usage
Questions that the prompts will ask:

In the future I plan to add more options for the user to add certain sections and create other files such as a LICENSE file from simply answering more detailed prompts so that the README.md generator is capable of touching all the bases of a professional readme file.
