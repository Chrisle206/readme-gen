# readme-gen

## Description

Tired of having to create README.md files for every project when the layout is mostly the same everytime? Well look no further! This command line utility application does just that! I created this application so that the tedious repetativeness of making README.md files from scratch is now solved.The application does this by prompting the user inside the terminal different questions about what they would like to include inside their README.md files. The detailed answers to their questions will populate the page in the designated sections allowing the user to generate the files with ease. I learned a lot about creating files using the 'fs' file system and prompting the user using the inquirer node packages.
